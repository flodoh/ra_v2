        # To calculate a grade level score:
        # 1. Randomly select three separate 100 word passages. 
        # 2. Count the number of sentences in each 100 word sample (estimate to nearest tenth).
        # 3. Count the number of syllables in each 100 word sample. (Each numeral is a syllable. For example, 2007 is 5 syllables -- two-thou-sand-se-ven -- and one word.)
        # 4. Plot the average sentence length and the average number of syllables on the graph.
        # The area in which it falls is the approximate grade
